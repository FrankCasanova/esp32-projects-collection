# esp32-projects-collection
A collection of hands-on projects using the ESP32-C3, focused on exploring key features such as GPIO control, Wi-Fi, low-power modes, interrupts, timers, and embedded Rust development. Each project is designed to be minimal, educational, and reusable â€” ideal for learning, prototyping, or extending into real applications.
